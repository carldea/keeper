This may not be what you want for your actual production builds that you plan to distribute. Normally, your app variant\u2019s minification task doesn\u2019t depend on compilation of its corresponding androidTest variant. This means you can call assembleRelease and assembleAndroidTestRelease won\u2019t inherently run. Keeper, however, changes this since it requires the compiled androidTest sources in order to correctly infer how they use APIs in the app variant. For a production build, you likely do want these \u201ctest-only\u201d APIs removed if possible though. There are a few patterns to better control this behavior via Gradle property. Simplest solution \u00b6 The simplest solution is to add a new build type that extends release but is solely used for these tests. This way it\u2019s identical to release in everything except the name. android { buildTypes { staging { initWith release } } testBuildType = \"staging\" } Now Keeper will only wire for the StagingAndroidTest build type and the assembleRelease dependency tree will remain untouched. This is the recommended solution, since builds that need this plugin likely already have custom logic in place for controlling testBuildType and it avoids messing with your normal release build. This is what we do internally at Slack as well. Property-based Examples \u00b6 Let\u2019s assume an example command to build a production app with custom property productionBuild . ./gradlew :myapp:assembleRelease -PproductionBuild = true Use the testBuildType option \u00b6 If you avoid setting your testBuildType to your \u201crelease\u201d build type in a production build, then Keeper won\u2019t configure your release artifact to depend on test sources since your release variant would no longer be the testedVariant of any androidTest variants. android { // ... if ( hasProperty ( \"productionBuild\" )) { testBuildType = \"debug\" } else { testBuildType = \"release\" } } Avoid applying the plugin entirely \u00b6 This is probably the simplest approach, but not as dynamic as controlling the testBuildType . if (! hasProperty ( \"productionBuild\" )) { apply plugin: \"com.slack.keeper\" } Variant filter \u00b6 By default, Keeper will run on any app variant that sets minifyEnabled to true. Alternatively, you can specify a variantFilter on the keeper extension and dynamically configure which variants Keeper operates on. This is nearly identical to AGP\u2019s native variantFilter API except that there is no defaultConfig property. Note: Variants with different enabled values will have to be compiled separately. This is common in most multi-variant projects anyway, but something to be aware of. keeper { variantFilter { if ( name == \"variantThatShouldTotallyBeIgnored\" ) { setIgnore ( true ) } } } \u00b6 Everyone\u2019s project is different, so you should do whatever works for you! We\u2019re open to suggestions of better ways to support configuration for this, so please do file issues if you have any proposals. Custom R8 behavior \u00b6 Keeper uses R8\u2019s PrintUses CLI under the hood for rules inference. By default it uses R8 version 1.6.53 . If you want to customize what version is used, you can specify the dependency via the keeperR8 configuration. Note that these must be tags from R8\u2019s r8-releases/raw maven repo. dependencies { keeperR8 \"com.android.tools:r8:x.y.z\" } If you don\u2019t want Keeper to automatically manage adding R8\u2019s maven repo, you can set disable it via automaticR8RepoManagement . Note that you\u2019ll need to manually add your own repo that the keeperR8 configuration mentioned above can resolve from. keeper { automaticR8RepoManagement = false } If you want to add custom JVM arguments to its invocation (i.e. for debugging), you and set them via the keeper extension. keeper { /** * Optional custom jvm arguments to pass into the R8 `PrintUses` execution. Useful if you want * to enable debugging in R8. Default is empty. * * Example: `listOf(\"-Xdebug\", \"-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=y\")` */ r8JvmArgs = [] } L8 rule sharing \u00b6 Library Desugaring (L8) was introduced in Android Gradle Plugin 4.0. To make this work, the R8 task will generate proguard rules indicating which j$ types are used in source, which the L8DexDesugarLibTask then uses to know which desugared APIs to keep. This approach can have flaws at runtime though, as the classpath of the test APK may not have the right j$ classes available on its classpath to run app code it is invoking. To work around this, you can enable rule sharing to make the AndroidTest-specific L8 task reuse the same L8-specific rules that the target variant does. keeper { enableL8RuleSharing = true }","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#simplest-solution","text":"The simplest solution is to add a new build type that extends release but is solely used for these tests.
